# Simple CSV Editor

Simple CSV Editor is just simple editor. Nothing much to say about it. It's much more readable thank plain text csv file. IMO very useful if you have a lot of text in your csv - if you you it as dictionary.

## Features

Show, edit and save CSV data. Really nothing much at this time.
