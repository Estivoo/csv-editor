# Simple CSV Editor

Simple CSV Editor is just simple editor. Nothing much to say about it. It's much more readable thank plain text csv file. IMO very useful if you have a lot of text in your csv - if you you it as dictionary.

## How to run

Use command palette ( shift + ctrl + p / ctrl + p and then type '>' ) and find Simple CSV Editor. Press enter ;)

## Features

Show, edit and save CSV data. Really nothing much at this time.

### Editor is providing realtime data changes.

### Is not bound to one csv at a time. You could easily work on multiple csv files, and editor will always be helpful without reloading.

### Do you want edit something in raw file? Or maybe you switched branch and content in file changed? No problem.
